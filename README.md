# Blockchain Supply Chain Tracking System

A comprehensive **Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain solution** for end-to-end supply chain traceability in agriculture. This project enables transparent, secure, and immutable tracking of farming products from the field to final packaging.

---

## Overview

This project implements a **decentralized supply chain tracking system** using Hyperledger Fabric. It ensures transparency, security, and trust among stakeholders by recording every transaction and event immutably on the blockchain.

The system supports multiple organizations, provides unique QR code tracking for each product batch, and maintains a verifiable chain of custody from farmers to consumers.

---

## Key Features

### Event Tracking

* Immutable recording of supply chain events
* Timestamp and geolocation data capture
* Environmental condition monitoring
* Compliance and certification tracking
* Multi-party verification and approval

### QR Code Integration

* Unique QR code generation per event
* Secure scanning and verification process
* Complete history access through final QR
* Mobile-friendly and web-compatible interface

### Blockchain Infrastructure

* Hyperledger Fabric network with multiple organizations
* Smart contract automation (chaincode)
* CouchDB as state database
* Certificate Authority (CA)-based identity management

---

## Technical Stack

**Backend**

* Hyperledger Fabric v2.4.x
* Go v1.17.x (Chaincode)
* Node.js v14.x (API server)
* CouchDB (state database)

**DevOps**

* Docker v20.10.x
* Docker Compose v2.0.x
* Shell and Python scripts for automation

---

## System Architecture

### Network Components

1. **Organizations**

   * Org1 – Farmers / Producers
   * Org2 – Transporters / Distributors
   * Org3 (Optional) – Retailers / Consumers

2. **Smart Contracts**

   * Asset Management
   * Event Logging
   * Access Control
   * QR Code Generation

3. **Core Services**

   * Ordering Service
   * Certificate Authorities
   * Peer Nodes
   * CouchDB Instances

---

### Supply Chain Workflow

1. **Initial Recording**

   * Farmer logs harvest details: crop type, harvest date, geolocation, and conditions
   * System generates an initial QR code
   * Data is stored immutably on the blockchain

2. **Transport Phase**

   * Transporter scans product QR
   * Handover details and transport conditions are recorded
   * Blockchain state is updated

3. **Processing & Storage**

   * Quality checks and storage conditions are recorded
   * Compliance certificates are attached
   * Chain of custody is preserved

4. **Final Packaging**

   * Complete history is compiled
   * Final consumer-facing QR code is generated
   * Consumer can access full product journey

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Update package manager
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Install Go
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.17.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Network Deployment

```bash
# Start the Hyperledger Fabric test network
cd test-network
./network.sh up createChannel -ca

# Deploy chaincode
./network.sh deployCC -ccn supplychain -ccp ../chaincode-go -ccl go

# Verify deployment
docker ps
```

### API Server Setup

```bash
cd ../api
go mod tidy
go run main/main.go
```

---

## API Endpoints

### Event Management

* `POST /api/events/create` – Create a new supply chain event
* `GET /api/events/{eventId}` – Retrieve details of a specific event

### QR Code Operations

* `POST /api/qr/generate` – Generate a new QR code linked to event data
* `GET /api/qr/{qrId}/verify` – Verify the authenticity of a QR code

### Product History

* `GET /api/product/{productId}/history` – Retrieve complete product history, including all events

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run chaincode tests
cd chaincode-go
go test ./chaincode/... -v

# Run API tests
cd ../api
go test ./... -v
```

Would you like me to also add a **diagram or flowchart (architecture + supply chain flow)** to visually complement the README? That can make it easier for developers and stakeholders to understand the system quickly.
